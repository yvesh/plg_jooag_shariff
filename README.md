<h2>Shariff integration for Joomla 3.3+</h2>

<h3>Attention:</h3>
<hr/>
<h6>Uninstall the Plugin before 3.0.13RC:</h6>
It's really to delete the old Plugin, because of the new Plugin is a System Plugin, the old one was a Content Plugin.
<h6>Share Counter:</h6>
It's really important for the counter to use the url only with www or non-www.
<h6>To redirect www to non-www do the following steps:</h6>
<ol>
<li>Rename the htaccess.txt in your joomla root folder to .htaccess</li>
<li>Add following lines in the end of the .htaccess file</li>
<pre>
# www to non-www
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1/$1 [R=301,L]
</pre>
or
<pre>
# non-www to www
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]
</pre>
<li>At least you need to open this plugin and save it again!</li>
</code>
</ol>
